# DbfToCsvConverter
A simple converter for DBF files. Currently the encoding of the DBF files is hardcoded. See [DBFRead's codepage.py](https://github.com/olemb/dbfread/blob/master/dbfread/codepages.py) for alternative encodings.

To use this script you need to install dbfread. `pip install dbfread` should do just that.
